Welcome to my personal overlay. Here you'll find ebuilds for software that I contribute to or that I need.

You can enable it as an `external ebuild repository <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf#External_ebuild_repository>`_ or clone it and register it as a `custom ebuild repository <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf#Custom_ebuild_repository>`_.

As usual, you should not blindly trust the content but instead review it before using.

See ``LICENSE`` for the repository license. Note that some files may be licensed differently, consult the file header for details.
